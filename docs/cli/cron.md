# `idlehands cron`

Manage cron jobs for the Gateway scheduler.

Related:

- Cron jobs: [Cron jobs](/automation/cron-jobs)

Tip: run `idlehands cron --help` for the full command surface.

Note: isolated `cron add` jobs default to `--announce` delivery. Use `--no-deliver` to keep
output internal. `--deliver` remains as a deprecated alias for `--announce`.

Note: one-shot (`--at`) jobs delete after success by default. Use `--keep-after-run` to keep them.

Note: recurring jobs now use exponential retry backoff after consecutive errors (30s → 1m → 5m → 15m → 60m), then return to normal schedule after the next successful run.

Note: retention/pruning is controlled in config:

- `cron.sessionRetention` (default `24h`) prunes completed isolated run sessions.
- `cron.runLog.maxBytes` + `cron.runLog.keepLines` prune `~/.idlehands/cron/runs/<jobId>.jsonl`.

## Common edits

Update delivery settings without changing the message:

```bash
idlehands cron edit <job-id> --announce --channel telegram --to "123456789"
```

Disable delivery for an isolated job:

```bash
idlehands cron edit <job-id> --no-deliver
```

Announce to a specific channel:

```bash
idlehands cron edit <job-id> --announce --channel slack --to "channel:C1234567890"
```
